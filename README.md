## Usage

Consider this code unstable. Copy and paste what you need into your own code for stability!

## Pathfinding

The `pathfinding` directory contains algorithms that find the shortest path from
start to goal. 

## Optimization

The `optimization` directory contains algorithms that find an optimal solution
to a problem that doesn't have a single clear goal.

## Adversarial

The `adversarial` directory contains algorithms that require an opponent.

## Bitset

The `bitset` directory contains functions wrapping common bitwise operations.

## Go performance tips

- Don't use `for _, copy := range`, use `for i := range` or `for i := 0; i < len(things); i++`.
- Don't use `map`, use arrays/slices: Amortized lookups add up.
- Pool objects by making a big array `var pool = make([]Thing, 1_000_000)`, grab items like `thing := &pool[cursor]; cursor++`
- Turn off Garbage Collection once most things are pooled `debug.SetGCPercent(-1)`
- Once GC is off, prefer objects on the stack (`Thing{}`) not the heap (`&Thing{}`)
- Use the built-in benchmark and profiling functionality to find slow spots
- For even more performance turn arrays into bitsets. If multiple values are possible on the same position, then use multiple uints as "layers" of the grid.
